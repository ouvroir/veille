          <note>
            <p>I am a Ramón y Cajal senior research fellow at the University of Barcelona. My main task in this position is to explore and teach new digital approaches to understand and communicate dynamics of past human activity.</p>
            <p>My current research is focused on three linked goals: a) to develop innovative digital methods to understand the complex relation between environment and past societies, b) to improve how conflict heritage is interpreted and c) to promote reflexive approaches to the human past through digital education techniques. I investigate these themes by applying innovative quantitative frameworks to a variety of topics such as the neolithic transition, the evolution of warfare or settlement dynamics.</p>

            <p>My research, publications, and teaching focus on Japanese cinema, media, and culture; early and silent cinema; the history and historiography of moving images and other visual media; film and media preservation; material culture studies; critical digital humanities practice; and the intersection between the history of the atomic age and popular culture. This work draws on my background in East Asian studies, film and media studies, film archiving and preservation, and photography and filmmaking. I seek out opportunities to collaborate and work across and in the spaces between traditional academic disciplines; today, this is where the issues and questions most relevant to the humanities reside. My most recent publications include two co-edited volumes (one on Japanese cinema and one on early cinema and provenance) and a book chapter for an edited volume, Recollecting Collecting (ed. Lucy Fischer), about how my experience as a collector informs my research and teaching. I am currently working on two book monographs, including a study of the cinema of Juzo Itami. In addition to my scholarship in print, I direct Re-Envisioning Japan, an ongoing digital humanities project comprising a physical collection and critical digital archive that documents changing images of Japan and its place in the world in the early to mid-twentieth-century. I enjoy working with students in adjacent disciplines, particularly in the Departments of Art and Art History, English, and History, and I support several of the university’s interdisciplinary programs, including Digital Media Studies (Advisory Committee), Film and Media Studies (former FMS director and interim FMS director), the Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation (a collaboration with George Eastman Museum), the Graduate Program in Visual and Cultural Studies (affiliated faculty), the Susan B. Anthony Institute for Woman and Gender Studies (Associate), the Literary Arts Programs (affiliated faculty), and the Graduate Program in Photographic Preservation and Collections Management (GEM collaboration, 2014-2019). My scholarship has received support from the ACLS, NEH, Fulbright, the Japan Foundation, the Association of Asian Studies North East Area Council, the Social Science Research Council, and the U.S.- Japan Friendship Commission.</p>

            <p>Born in New Mexico and raised in Oregon, Dr. Sheila K. Hoffman has lived in 5 different countries and adventured through more than 40 others on 5 continents as a
 scholar of art history, world cultures and symbols. She refers to herself as, “A female Robert Langdon (minus the tweed) with a passion for all things ancient, a sci-fi geek and an incurable explorer, a culinary crusader, foodie adventurer and pretty good cook.”</p>
            <p>In addition to more than 20 years of experience in museums as a curator and director,
 Sheila has two doctoral degrees: one from The Sorbonne in Paris in Art History and the
 other from the Université du Québec à Montréal in Museology, Heritage and Cultural Mediation. Her dissertation, written and defended in French, on how digital technologies can transform world heritage was fully funded by Canada’s prestigious Vanier scholarship. She has also authored several books and articles, including an acclaimed examination of indigenous ceramics of the Southwestern United States. She is Senior Lecturer in Art History at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and has lectured around the world as a guest of governments and universities, including the Smithsonian, Tufts, Carnegie Mellon, Université de Paris VI, and to inaugurate the Nanjing University Cultural History and Museology Program. She served as one of the founding Reviews Editors for the International Museum Worlds Journal. And in 2020, her outstanding achievements in the cultural sector were honored with the Arts Luminary Award, given by the University of Oklahoma, where she conducted her master’s studies.</p>
            <p>Sheila has appeared on many science-based television series, appearing on the Science, Discovery and Travel Channels among others as an expert contributor on numerous topics related to ancient cultures and religions. She has lectured across the globe on topics ranging from the history of museums and indigenous collections to the use of cutting-edge technologies in cultural heritage. From ancient symbols to digital culture, Sheila believes fiercely in the power of cultural images and objects to transform our understanding of the world we share. When she’s not studying or teaching, you can find her exploring the world by bike, kayak, camera or cuisine.</p>

She is an Assistant Professor of non-Western Art History at California State University, Channel Islands. Prior to that she managed the Simon Burrow Collection of maps and books for the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. As a Mexican descent citizen of the United States who has and continues to live, study, and work in California, New Mexico, and Arizona she specializes in the history, practices, and systems that impact contemporary Latin@x communities within the U.S. southwest. As a scholar and curator her work focuses on the intersections between the visual and political, on a national and global scale, as she interrogates historiography, nation-building, systems of differentiation, social justice struggles, and civil rights protest. Recent publications include Making and Being Made: Contemporary Citizenship, Art, and Visual Culture (2017), which she co-edited; the essay “Icons of the Mexican Revolution: Constructions of Emiliano Zapata in Prints of the Mexican Revolution” in the book Imprints of Revolution: Visual Representations of Resistance (2016); and she also co-edited a special issue of Third Text (2014) focused on “Art and Revolution in Mexico.” She has also curated numerous exhibitions, such as Greater Arizona: Mapping Place, History, and Transformation (2017) at Arizona State University; Legacy of the Mexican Revolution (2015) for the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, University of New Mexico; and Imagined Regions: The Simon Burrow Transborder Map Collection (2015) for the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. Avila firmly believes we must activate art in meaningful ways, and she dedicates herself to community oriented projects that engage art as a tool for change.</p>

            <p>Lindsay S. Cook (she/her) is an architectural historian, medievalist, digital humanist, translator, and digital preservation advocate. A specialist in medieval European architecture, Dr. Cook’s current research addresses architectural and artistic responses to the Gothic cathedral Notre-Dame of Paris, medievalism in African American architecture, medieval architectural space, and digital and material approaches to the valorization, conservation, and restoration of cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>Her research on medieval, early modern, modern, and contemporary histories of Notre-Dame has recently appeared in the journals Future Anterior and Different Visions and the edited volume The Analysis of Gothic Architecture (Brill, 2023). Notre-Dame Cathedral: Nine Centuries of History, her English translation of the French-language monograph co-authored by Dany Sandron and Andrew Tallon, was published by Penn State University Press in 2020. She is currently writing a monograph about architectural and artistic responses to Notre-Dame from the 12th century to the present.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cook was a member of the multi-year digital humanities projects Mapping Gothic, Life of a Cathedral: Notre-Dame of Amiens, and Musiconis, and, from 2021-2024, she chaired the Digital Resources Committee of the International Center of Medieval Art (ICMA). She is a board member of the scholarly association Scientifiques de Notre-Dame, a member of the advisory board of the non-profit educational organization Handshouse Studio, and editor of The Notre-Dame Translation Project, which makes open-educational resources about the history, conservation, and restoration of Notre-Dame following the catastrophic 2019 fire available to students and the general public.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cook teachers upper-level courses about the architectural history of the medieval world and theories and practices of conservation, as well as broader architectural history surveys.</p>
